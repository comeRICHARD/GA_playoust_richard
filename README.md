Genetic code 

On this repo you will find a module GA_solver which allows you to resolve problems that can be transposable to a genetic problem.
For example you have a mastermind and a cities problem using the GA_solver. If you want to resolve a problem using the same logic, create your "YOURPROBLEMNAME_problem.py" file like the mastermind_problem and tsp_problem to initiate it. Then use the GA_solver like in the two others examples.
