Genetic code 

On this repo you will find a module GA_solver which allows you to resolve problems that can be transposable to a genetic problem.

For example you have a mastermind and a cities problem that can be resolved using the GA_solver. 

If you want to solve other problems, you have to create a new child class of GAProblem. Then implement the methods of GAProblem in regards of your new problem.
